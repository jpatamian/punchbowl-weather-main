# README

I took over this page so I could add some notes/instructions. In order to use User.first, I added a seed User that will need to be added when you spin up the app in order for it to query favorites :)

For the last part of the challenge (API Limits), I decided to go with low level caching. We can discuss this more in person, but I felt it was the right course for this type of application/test setting. I considered implementing tanstack which I know has a good query cache as well as creating a sidekiq job to add the API requests to a queue that can retry, but I thougth that might be going overboard.

I am used to using rspec so I did the best I could with the test suite, but there are likely ways it could have been done better
